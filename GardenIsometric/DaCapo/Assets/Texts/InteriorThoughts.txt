Arnoux: An unlit fireplace, huh? Well it is pretty cold in here...
Good thing I found these matches.
*(You light the fire with the matches.)*
*(The old logs are quickly consumed by the fire.)*
Arnoux: Hm? What's that glinting under the logs?

Arnoux: It's warm enough now, maybe I should see what that thing is under the logs...
I wonder how I can put out the fire?
I'll just douse the flames with this bucket of water.
*(The fire is put out.)*
Arnoux: It looks like that thing I saw was a key of some sort.
*(You acquired the scorched key.)*

*(You acquired a box of matches.)*

*(You acquired an empty bucket.)*

*(You filled the empty bucket with water.)*

Arnoux: This door seems to be locked.
Maybe this key I found can open it.
*(You used the scorched key and the door unlocks.)*
