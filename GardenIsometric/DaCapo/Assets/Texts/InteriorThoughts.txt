Arnoux: An unlit fireplace, huh? Well it is pretty cold in here...
Good thing I found these matches.
*(You light the fire with the matches.)*
*(The old logs are quickly consumed by the fire.)*
Arnoux: Hm? What's that glinting under the logs?

Arnoux: It's warm enough now, maybe I should see what that thing is under the logs...
I wonder how I can put out the fire?
I'll just douse the flames with this bucket of water.
*(The fire is put out.)*
Arnoux: It looks like that thing I saw was a key of some sort.
*(You acquired the scorched key.)*

*(You acquired a box of matches.)*

*(You acquired an empty bucket.)*

Arnoux: I wonder how much he paid to get running water all the way out in the middle of nowhere.
*(You filled the empty bucket with water.)*

Arnoux: This door seems to be locked.
Maybe this key I found can open it.
*(You used the scorched key and the door unlocks.)*

Arnoux: This door won't budge.

Arnoux: These windows are locked tight...
But it's a nice day outside!

Arnoux: It looks like he's pretty far into this book: "Il Nome della Rosa."
Huh, I've never read this one.
*(You briefly flip through the pages.)*
Arnoux: Hey, what's this?
*(You got coded note #3)*

Arnoux: The sink looks nice but doesn't seem to be working.




Arnoux: Nothing but clothes in here...

Arnoux: Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Chekov, Lermontov, Gogol, Pushkin...
I've read some of these, pretty dreary stuff.

Arnoux: 'The Principles of Agriculture and Vegetation' by Francis Home...
Eight separate editions of 'The Gardener's Dictionary' by Philip Miller...
Is this really how he's been spending all of his time?

Arnoux: Montesquieu's 'Spirit of Laws,' Cicero's 'Tusculan Questions,' Hobbes' 'Leviathan'...
Political writing was always a bit too dry for me.

Arnoux: 'History of the Peloponnesian War' by Thucydides, 'Historia Arcana' by Precopius...
'Notes on the State of Virginia' by Thomas Jefferson...
Passes the time I suppose.

Arnoux: Ah, here we go: Victor Hugo, Emile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustav Flaubert...
Love these guys.
Wait a minute, it looks like there's a note wedged between these two books.
*(You got coded note #2)*



Arnoux: This painting depicts a dragon resting on a mountaintop.
Cool stuff.

Arnoux: A beautiful gazebo surrounded by a lush garden...
Hmm, what's this?
*(You grab a small note sticking out from behind the painting.)*
*(You got coded note #4)*

Arnoux: Jeez, he can't even smile for a portrait with his own dog.

Arnoux: A snapshot of the infinite cosmos in all of its majesty...
Or something like that. 

Arnoux: This journal contains sketches for some kind of new farming plot.
I guess he's been growing his own food.
*(You check under the table.)*
Arnoux: Strange, there's some notes taped under here.
*(You got cipher note and coded note #1)*

*(A strong box with a keypad lock.)*
Arnoux: Is there something glowing in there?
Maybe I should try to figure out the code.
I think these notes I found might be the key to opening it.

*(You peer into the chest and see another scrap of sheet music.)*
*(You got another scrap of sheet music.)*

Arnoux: A big locked door with no handle. Well that's not suspicious at all...
Perhaps this key I found will open it.
*(You try using the scorched key to open the door, but it doesn't fit.)*
Arnoux: Maybe this key unlocks something else.

Arnoux: A vase full of freshly picked flowers.
They smell great.

Arnoux: A potted fern. Very exciting.

Arnoux: These vegetables look freshly picked and washed.

Arnoux: Looks like a regular old cutting board and knife except...
*(You look under the knife and notice two small spikes jutting out of the board.)*
Arnoux: I wonder what those are for...

Arnoux: Ceramic plates arranged in two neat little stacks.

Arnoux: A gas-powered stove. Better not mess with it.

Arnoux: A pair of stainless steel cooking pots. Although...
*(On closer inspection, you notice that the pot with the lid has some sort of bizarre wire-frame and handle attached to it.)*
Arnoux: Well that's weird.

Arnoux: I could really go for some tea after all that walking through the woods, but it looks like the pot is empty.

*(You make a face at yourself in the mirror.)*
Arnoux: Well that felt good.

Arnoux: This bed definitely looks cozy.

Arnoux: The nightstand is jammed shut.

Arnoux: Good thing I used the bathroom before I left today.

Arnoux: A lovely flower painting. The pattern of the petals seems especially detailed.

Arnoux: I don't think I have time to take a shower.

Arnoux: Looks like most of the books on this desk involve rose cultivation techniques. Although...
*(You notice that the open book on the desk is actually being held open by some kind of clasp mechanism.)*
Arnoux: Interesting...

Arnoux: There's a handful of crumpled balls of paper in here.
*(You pickup and unfold one of them.)*
Arnoux: It's a rough pencil sketch of a rose. Looks like he smudged part of it pretty badly though. Oh well.
*(You return the sketch to the waste basket.)*
