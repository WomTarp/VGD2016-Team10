Arnoux: An unlit fireplace, huh? Well it is pretty cold in here...
Good thing I found these matches.
*(You light the fire with the matches.)*
*(The old logs are quickly consumed by the fire.)*
Arnoux: Hm? What's that glinting under the logs?

Arnoux: It's warm enough now, maybe I should see what that thing is under the logs...
I wonder how I can put out the fire?
I'll just douse the flames with this bucket of water.
*(The fire is put out.)*
Arnoux: It looks like that thing I saw was a key of some sort.
*(You acquired the scorched key.)*

*(You acquired a box of matches.)*

*(You acquired an empty bucket.)*

Arnoux: I wonder how much he paid to get running water all the way out in the middle of nowhere.
*(You filled the empty bucket with water.)*

Arnoux: This door seems to be locked.
Maybe this key I found can open it.
*(You used the scorched key and the door unlocks.)*

Arnoux: This door won't budge.

Arnoux: These windows are locked tight...
But it's a nice day outside!

Arnoux: It looks like he's pretty far into this book: "Il Nome della Rosa."
Huh, I've never read this one.

Arnoux: The sink looks nice but doesn't seem to be working.

Arnoux: It seems he's working on sketches for some kind of new farming plot.
I guess he's been growing his own food.

Arnoux: Nothing but clothes in here...

Arnoux: Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Chekov, Lermontov, Gogol, Pushkin...
I've read some of these, pretty dreary stuff.
