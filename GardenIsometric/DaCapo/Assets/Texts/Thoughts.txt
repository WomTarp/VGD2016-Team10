Arnoux: The door is locked and no one is answering. 
Is this 'Moreau' really the person I’ve been looking for?

Arnoux: Strange... I don't remember this gate having a lock when I came in. 
Is there a key somewhere around here?

Arnoux: Awww. Who's a good dog?
Here's a stick, boy! Go fetch!
*(The dog goes and plays with the stick.)*

Arnoux: He looks so happy playing with that stick.

Arnoux: Oh, there's a big stick on the ground.
And that dog does seem a little bored...
*(You got a stick.)*

Arnoux: The curtains are drawn, I can't see anything inside.

Arnoux: An odd looking fountain--I wonder what these symbols mean... 
I've heard a lot of weird stories about this place.
I think the locals would be very superstitious about this sort of thing.

Arnoux: This dog house is pretty old. I wonder if Mr. Doggy wouldn't mind a house visit.
Hmm? What's this piece of paper in the back?
Why is there a piece of sheet music in this dog house?
*(You got a crumpled sheet of music paper.)*
