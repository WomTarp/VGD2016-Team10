The dog seems like it wants to play.
You throw the stick.
The dog goes and plays with the stick.

A strong iron gate.
You sense a curious nature about the gate.
The gate is locked by a mysterious force.

There is a stick on the ground.
You pick up the stick.

You inspect the dog house.
It's fairly dark, but after searching the inside, you find something.
You found a crumpled music sheet.

The dog is playing with the stick.
